This is a collection of social icons in SVG format for you to freely use in your website.

### Usage

---

I have included the `path` tags with the SVG code of the following icons:

- Dribbble
- Github
- Google+
- LinkedIn
- Quora
- Rdio
- Reddit
- Skype
- Twitter

You will also find the actual .svg files that I have created for all the social icons.
